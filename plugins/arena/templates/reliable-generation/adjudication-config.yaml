# Adjudication Configuration
# Controls how the adjudicator evaluates critiques and decides on approval

# Approval criteria - when to mark artifact as approved
approval:
  # Block approval if any issues at these severities remain unresolved
  block_on: [CRITICAL, HIGH]

  # Alternative: use named policy instead of block_on
  # policy: no_critical           # Approve if no CRITICAL issues
  # policy: no_critical_or_high   # Approve if no CRITICAL or HIGH issues
  # policy: all_resolved          # Approve only when all issues resolved

# HITL escalation - when to ask human for help
escalation:
  triggers:
    - max_iterations        # Reached iteration limit without approval
    - thrashing             # Same issue returns after 2+ fix attempts
    - conflicting_criticals # Fixing one CRITICAL breaks another CRITICAL

# Tension guidance - help adjudicator balance competing constraints
# Define axes where constraints may pull in opposite directions
tensions: []
  # Example:
  # - axis: "engagement vs safety"
  #   guidance: |
  #     Maximize engagement without crossing into harmful content.
  #     When in doubt, prefer safety over excitement.
  #   winner_on_conflict: safety  # Which constraint wins if irreconcilable

  # - axis: "completeness vs conciseness"
  #   guidance: |
  #     Cover all requirements but avoid unnecessary verbosity.
  #     Prefer completeness unless content becomes repetitive.

# Custom adjudicator instructions (optional)
# Additional context or domain-specific rules for the adjudicator
instructions: |
  # Add any special instructions here, for example:
  # - "This content is for children, err on the side of caution"
  # - "Prefer formal tone over casual"
  # - "Technical accuracy is more important than readability"
